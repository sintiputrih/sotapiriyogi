The never-before-seen snap, which was originally posted by Cole's wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Cynthia</a>, had been shared to commemorate Ryland's 19th birthday.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Everything you need to know about the cast of Yellowstone</figure><p id=eIOyVf93pN5 data-wc=47>Revealing his close bond with his eldest, Cole couldn't have looked happier as he posed with his son, then a tiny tot, and his wife Cynthia. The couple, who have been together for 22 years, are also proud parents to son Colt, 14, and daughter Steely, 10.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50b88b0bb14b-cole-hauser-with-baby-ryland-and-wife-cynthia.jpg><p id=emLmXABOqrM data-wc=60>Seen sporting his auburn curls in the picture, fans might be surprised by how different Cole looks, especially compared to his Yellowstone&nbsp;character, Rip Wheeler. Cole has previously spoken about the intense transformation that he's undergone for Yellowstone and in an interview with Jenny McCarthy, he opened up about the real reason he dyes his hair, which is naturally red.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Yellowstone Latest</h4><p id=ebEsQqYlRlh data-wc=65>Revealing that the show's creator, Taylor Sheridan, had suggested he dye it to avoid looking too similar to his on-screen love interest Kelly Reilly, Cole explained: "When I first got the role, as you know Kelly's a ginger and I'm ginger as well. So we looked like we were brother and sister! So we kind of had to make sure that wouldn't be the case."&nbsp;</p><p id=eyz9clUGCQ5 data-wc=29>He added: "I've dyed it for other stuff that I've done. They liked that look, and it's kind of a harder look. Your eyes pop a little bit more."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4f32c8d7657c-yellowstone-beth-and-rip.jpg><p id=ecxXy4W4754 data-wc=54>Back in June 2022, Cole also opened up about altering his weight for the role of Rip. "Ultimately, when I walk around, I'm about 210 [pounds]," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Express</a>. "I put on, sometimes, about 20 pounds just to fill him out. And get a little bit more [expletive] and legs on him, you know!"</p><p id=e2jRVs_x1Kl data-wc=40>While Cole would typically have returned to set by now, the TV star is currently on hiatus due the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes. Few updates on production have been revealed, although the last known one came from Kayce Dutton in July.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/546a48fddfaf-luke-grimes.jpg><p id=enNXg2BBjr5 data-wc=52>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, he explained: "We have not [started filming the second half of season 5] because of the writers' strike. I think we would be if it weren't for that. But that takes precedence over everything. They've got to get that all sorted, and then we'll be getting after it." &nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Why are actors going on strike?</h3><p id=eKXQuUpV1j>SAG-AFTRA member voted to strike on July 13 2023.&nbsp;</p><p id=eI2HVgTmNA>In 2022 it was reported that the average hourly pay for a California actor was $27.73 per hour. But many working actors do not work Monday-Friday 9am - 5pm jobs, and 86% of the 160,000 strong guild do not make more than $25,950 in covered earnings (money that contributes towards social security) per year, and therefore do not qualify for healthcare insurance.</p><p id=e7DfqWihsr>Actors also receive financial compensations when their TV shows are syndicated, rerun, have a DVD release or enjoy a move to streaming services. The calculation is complex and can change depending on initial contract, length of time an actor has had guild membership, and the type of production. As an example the Friends&nbsp;cast – Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry – receive 2% of the syndication revenue for their hit WB show, meaning their annually bring in around $20million each. But as streaming services such as Netflix continue to refuse to share ratings, it makes it unclear how often content is played and it lowers an actor's residual calculation.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5de9FAHP4Y>The SAG and Writers Guild of America members are also both fighting AMPTP over protections for their work against Artificial Intelligence, and fears that technology would replace humans.</p><p id=eI9aAGa7LvZ data-wc=29>The labor action has also stalled production on the second season of the prequel series 1923 as well as the development of the upcoming Yellowstone spin-off starring <a class=hm-link href=#>Matthew McConaughey.</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f49fbb93be8f-cole-hauser-wife-cynthia-children.jpg><p id=eXErpDSpF0T data-wc=34>In the meantime, however, Cole has made the most of his time away from the show by <a class=hm-link href=#>launching his very own coffee company</a>, Free Rein, as well as spending the summer with his family.&nbsp;</p><p id=eL88B-IddBJ data-wc=138>Even before the strikes put everything on hold, the future of the original Yellowstone&nbsp;series had been in doubt for months — thanks to the premature departure of headlining star <a class=hm-link href=#>Kevin Costner</a>, who had been eager to move on to other projects and has also been dealing with a contentious divorce from wife Christine Baumgarten. Fans last saw a brand-new episode of the Paramount+ series way back in November 2022, which was considered the mid-season finale of season five. Filming for the second half of season five, which would mark the end of the show, never got underway due to the strikes. But the fate of Kevin's protagonist, Montana rancher John Dutton, was up in the air. <a class=hm-link href=#>Series creator Taylor Sheridan,</a> who has reportedly been feuding with Kevin, hinted that it's possible Kevin's character might be killed off.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0DpXDXrb1z data-wc=36>“Whether [Dutton’s fate] inflates [Costner’s] ego or insults is collateral damage that I don’t factor in with regard to storytelling," Taylor said, insisting any potential character death will not be tied to his disagreements with Kevin.</p><figure><br></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnyRcmxuZ6maua271qyrqKaVYrCwuMRmn5qto5q%2FbsHNq5yom5ejtrutwaWcZqGeYsGpvs6wmZqbm2K9qbvTqGSmmaKgwG6%2Fzqdkq7Gclrulv4yboKusmJmuuns%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./christina-kalamvokis.html>&#171;&nbsp;Christina Kalamvokis - Bio, Net Worth, Nationality, Career, Facts</a>
