former picturesque life and career served as the basis of USA Network’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chrisley Knows Best</a>. The reality TV series, which finished its ninth season Dec. 2021, follows the multimillionaire real estate developer, 53, and his lavish life with his wife <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julie</strong></a> and their children. Behind every picture-perfect family, however, lies drama and other familial problems, as is the nature of things; in the Chrisley clans’ case, the drama plays both on television and off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The reality father and mother were found <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>guilty of bank fraud and tax evasion</a> on June 7, 2022 from a scheme that lasted between 2007 and 2012 — before they landed their hit series. Todd was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, bank fraud, and tax fraud, and Julie was convicted of tax fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. They were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sentenced to a combined 19 years</a> in prison on Nov. 21, 2022 and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>began serving their sentences</a> (seven years for Julie and 12 years for Todd) on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The pair left behind five children as they headed to jail: <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lindsie</strong></a>, 33, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle</strong></a>, 31, whom Todd shares with ex-wife <strong>Teresa Terry</strong>, and<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Chase</strong></a>, 26, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Savannah</strong></a>, 25, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Grayson</strong></a>, 16, whom Todd shares with Julie. Savannah revealed in November that she would<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> obtain custody of her Grayson</a>, as well as Kyle and his ex-wife, <strong>Teresa Terry</strong>‘s daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>10-year-old <strong>Chloe</strong></a>, who Todd and Julie gained custody of in 2016. They also transferred&nbsp; Read on to learn more about the Chrisley children and grandchildren.</p><h2>Lindsie Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Born on September 17, 1989 to Todd and his first-wife Teresa, Lindsie is the reality star’s eldest child. She appeared on the family reality show when it debuted in 2014, but left in 2017 and was estranged from her father and family until 2022. Tensions with her family began when her brother, Kyle, accused her (and their mother) of turning Todd and Julie into authorities for alleged tax evasion. Her attorneys have denied this. However, Lindsie has maintained that there “will never be a reconciliation” between her and her family. “I think that the most that anyone could ask for at this point is for everyone to go on with their lives as they see fit and to just leave the other side alone,” she told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Entertainment Tonight</a> in Sept. 2021. “But at this point, there will be no chance for reconciliation. And unfortunately, I’m going to continue to respond to whatever allegations are put out.”</p><p class=_a9zs><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Despite her estrangement from her father, Lindsie expressed concern for him due to his legal troubles in May 2022. Sharing a photo of herself and her son, <strong>Jackson</strong> on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> (seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>), she wrote, “Family is what brings out the most emotion in us. When Love is deep & strong, our differences don’t matter. All that matters is the truth, & that will set you free.” She continued, “Papa & Mimi, we love you, we stand with you, trust you, believe you, & are praying for you. I know you are innocent, I pray that the system does not fail our family & the jury sees the truth. To those who’ve haunted our family for years, I pray that you will be seen & we will be heard. “</span></p><p class=_a9zs><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">“⁣</span><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Please pray for my parents, our grandmother, us as their children, their grandchildren & our legal teams,” she concluded.⁣</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Two weeks after their Nov. 2022 sentencing, Lindsie told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>,in an EXCLUSIVE statement that she was “heartbroken” over the news. “I wanted to take a minute and first of all, say thank you to all of our listeners that have reached out to me the past few weeks regarding my family,” she began. “I wanted to take a step back and begin to process everything before speaking and making any statements. The past few months have been extremely hard for me and my family, and I am heartbroken over the updates in my parents’ case that occurred late last month.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The statement, which was then released on the Dec. 8, 2022 episode of her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Coffee Convos</a> podcast, continued, “I know some of the media has tried to twist my response to this and make it something it’s not, but at the end of the day, there is no tea here. I am heartbroken and navigating this process the best way I know how. At the end of the day, this is a real family, and these are real and raw emotions. With that being said, thank you all for your love, support, and prayers. It really means the world to my family and me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In addition to Coffee Convos, the reality star also hosts the podcast <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Southern Tea</a>. As mentioned above, she has one son, Jackson whom she shares with her ex-husband <strong>Will Campbell</strong>. She announced in July 2021 that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she and Will would be separating</a> after nine years of marriage and their divorce was finalized in October.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Lindsie revealed in a Nov. 2022 episode of her Southern Tea podcast that she was able to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reconnect with Todd</a> following her divorce.&nbsp;“The most common question I think is people wanting to know if we reconnected because of the trial or because of my divorce. I can confidently tell you there was no reconnection due to any legal reasons whatsoever. Nothing like that ever transpired,” she explained.</p><h2>Kyle Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Kylie is Todd and Teresa’s second child and was born on Aug. 29, 1991. Kyle and Todd have endured a tumultuous relationship that has weathered many storms, as documented in the first season of Chrisley Knows Best due to Kyle’s struggles with substance abuse and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his mental health</a>. He is now sober and has since repaired his relationship with his father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>He even penned a birthday tribute to his dad, seen above, in 2021 and said he was “proud” to be his son. “Happy Birthday Daddy! You have a faith in all of us like Jesus does and I could never thank you enough for believing in the best of me,” he wrote on Instagram on April 6 of that year. “That faith is what brought me to where I am today. I am so proud to be your son. I hope you have the best day! I love you so much!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Kyle<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> showed support for this father</a> under his last post — which has since been restricted — before he reported to prison.&nbsp; “I love you daddy this isn’t over,” Kyle commented under<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the post</a>, which had&nbsp;gospel singer&nbsp;<strong>Karen Peck&nbsp;</strong>singing her song “Four Days Late”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Kyle shares his daughter, Chloe, with his ex-girlfriend<strong> Angela Victoria Johnson</strong>. In April 2021, Kylie married his girlfriend, <strong>Ashleigh Nelson</strong>, who he previously <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed</a> gave him “a reason to get out of bed and try to be the best person” he could be in a heartfelt <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post. These days, Kyle is creating internet content with her on their joint <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a> account.</p><h2>Chase Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Born on June 1, 1996, Chase is Todd and Julie’s eldest son together and the middle child of Todd. He has a positive relationship with his father, who has even taken it upon himself to meddle in on his son’s love life every now and then, setting him up with women following Chase’s split from girlfriend <strong>Brooke Noury</strong>. Luckily, Chase doesn’t need any help, as in Oct. 2022, he announced&nbsp; that he and his girlfriend of almost three years, <strong>Emmy Medders</strong>, were engaged.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>“I am the luckiest man in the world, being able to call you mine forever is a blessing straight from God. You are the sunshine when it’s dark, you are the rain when it’s dry,” he wrote alongside a gorgeous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of himself on one knee asking Emmy to be his wife. “I love you more than life itself and can’t wait to live forever with you! To you my love! Thank you for taking me FOREVER!! @emmymedders”</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>it was cancelled</a>, Chase starred in the Chrisley Knows Best spin-off show titled Growing Up Chrisley with his younger sister, Savannah. It followed the brother-sister duo as they embarked attempted to create a new life in Los Angeles to prove to their father that they can make it on their own.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>In the Hollywood Hills, Chase has been pursuing a career as an actor. These days, he’s also the founder of his own candle company, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chase Chrisley Collection</a>. “Candles have always been a passion of mine since I was a little kid,” his site states. “Growing up my mom always had aromatic candles around the house so our home always felt overwhelmed with welcoming scents. I believe that the scent of a candle can control the entire mood of the room.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Chase very<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> cryptically reacted to his parents’ prison sentence</a> in a Nov. 22 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story, which can be seen above. In his story, he shared a tale about a widowed man encouraging his friend to make his wife chili even though he might not have felt like it. “It took me a few minutes to realize we were no longer talking about dinner. It was about going out of your way to do something for someone you love because at any moment, they could unexpectedly be taken from you,” the writing read.”</p><h2>Savannah Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-31>Savannah is Todd and Julie’s second child and was born on Aug. 11, 1997. Like her brother Chase, Savannah has a generally great relationship with her father. For a Father’s Day tribute in 2020, Savannah paid homage to Todd on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and recalled each other being nearly inseparable. “I look back on my life and realize that we were pretty much ALWAYS inseparable! You dressing me up like a little doll…paying me $1 for every song I learned to sing…and so much more,” she captioned the sweet <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. “I thank God every day for giving me a father who has always been there and who has never wavered. . . I love you and thank you for saving me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>Aside from starring on the now canceled Growing Up Chrisley, Savannah launched a beauty line called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sassy By Savannah Chrisley</a>, which sells fragrances and makeup products. She also launched her debut clothing collection on HSN.com and credited her father for her business savviness 2017. “He has been absolutely amazing. My dad has been the biggest supporter of me throughout. He’s my best friend and without him I couldn’t have made it happen,” she gushed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>Like her sister, Savannah has a podcast of her own, which is called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-34>Unsurprisingly, she posted on social media <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>following her parents’ guilty verdict</a>. Alongside a quote about being positive about life despite hardships, she wrote, “This life is so cruel and we’re all doing the best we can. I will continue to stand by my family and fight for justice. Justice for ourselves and for others that the system has failed. (There is only so much I can comment on legally at this moment.)”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She continued, “Recently, I’ve felt let down by God, that my relentless prayers have been unheard. But I do believe that He will use every hardship and adversity we go through to strengthen us and prepare us for an even greater purpose. So I will continue believing in our Lord and Savior. This fight isn’t over.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-37>Following her parents’ sentencing, she took to her Instagram Story to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share a quote by&nbsp;pastor<strong> Kimberly Jones</strong></a>. “Noah didn’t stop building the ark to explain himself to everyone who doubted and hated on him. Keep building your ark. The rain will do the talking,” the quote read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-38>She also commented on Todd’s final post before reporting to prison with her brother, writing, “I love you daddy,” with a red heart emoji under his video.</p><h2>Grayson Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-41>Born on May 16, 2006 to Todd and Julie, Grayson is the reality couple’s youngest child. Like his siblings Chase and Savannah, Grayson appears to have a fantastic relationship with his father. On his 15th birthday, Todd paid tribute to his youngest on Instagram (seen above) and called him a “kind, caring, compassionate young man.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-42>Grayson boasts 300,000 followers on his official <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, where he mostly shared workout content. The young teen is currently in high school. Along with starring in his family’s reality show, he made a cameo in the TV film Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens. Perhaps a career in Hollywood is on the horizon.</p><h2>Todd’s Grandchildren</h2><h2>Chloe Chrisley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-45><strong>Chloe Chrisley</strong> is Todd’s oldest grandchild and as mentioned above, is the daughter of Todd’s son, Kyle, and his ex, Angela Johnson. She was born in 2012 and has appeared on Chrisley Knows Best. She quickly stole the hearts of fans with her funny and joyous personality. Chloe was placed under the care of Todd and Julie because of Kyle’s struggles to stay sober and due to her mother falsely claimed her as a dependent to obtain Medicaid and food stamps, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-46>Amid their legal troubles, however, Angela claimed she will try to gain custody of her daughter back. “I’ve held back for so long to try to patiently do it,” she told TMZ in an emotional video. “And I don’t think it’s right for them to pretend that I don’t exist and just say, ‘Oh, we’re just going to let Savannah get her.’ That don’t make sense.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-47>“Todd and Julie are saddened by the unfortunate and misleading narrative currently being portrayed in the media regarding Chloe,” Todd and Chrisley responded via a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><h2>Jackson Campbell</h2><p id=content-paragraph-48><strong>Jackson Campbell</strong> is Todd’s second oldest grandchild. He is the son of Todd’s daughter Lindsie and her ex, Will Campbell and was born in 2013. Due to Todd and Lindsie’s fragile relationship, Jackson’s interactions with his family have been minimal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Oom51lk52%2Fqr%2FLnrBmo5mZwG6AlHBram9kZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./george-shinn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;George Shinn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a>
