"It's really upsetting for two kids who are trying to process their parents' separation. And sometimes I just feel like this is all a bad dream and that I'm going to wake up at some point. But no, it's real. And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media. And all of this while my dad has been in the ICU and I've been fighting on different fronts. Like I said, this is probably the darkest hour of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, "For [women] like me who believe in values like family who had the dream, the big dream of having a family forever, to see that dream broken or shredded into pieces is probably one of the most painful things that you can ever go through.

And I did it. I put my career in second gear and I came to Spain, to support him so he could play football and win titles. And it was a sacrifice of love," Shakira said. "Thanks to that, my kids were able to have a present mom, and I have this amazing bond with them that is unbreakable and that sustains us. You know, that is it. That's all I can say."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 2022: They call it quits.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To fans' surprise, the singer and soccer star dropped the sudden news that they had broken up after 12 years together.
