Spiewak, who was working in advertising as a graphic designer at the time, has said the connection between him and Parsons "was pretty quick." It sure sounds so: Spiewak's song choice that night was Cher's "I Found Someone."</p><p>Having met while just starting out in the filming industry, the couple dated for a long time before finally revealing their relationship to the world. In August 2010, after being nominated for lead actor in a comedy series the previous year, Parsons takes home his first win at the Emmys for playing Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory. Toward the end of his acceptance speech, he says "And most of all, I love you, Mom," followed by a list of names, including Todd Spiewak.
