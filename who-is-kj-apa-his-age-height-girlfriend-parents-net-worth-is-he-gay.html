parents, net worth, is he gay?</h1><div id=sub-header>February 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>KJ Apa is an actor who rose to fame through his appearance on soap opera&nbsp;</span><span>Rue Shortland</span><span>&nbsp;and the drama series&nbsp;</span><span>Riverdale</span><span>&nbsp;Only starting his career in 2013, Apa has done very well in a very short time, with many appearances helping him earn his place on screen.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is KJ Apa?&nbsp;– Biography and Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Even though it is simply as KJ Apa that the actor is very popular, he was born Keneti James Fitzgerald Apa on June 17, 1997 in his home country of New Zealand, Auckland.&nbsp;Her father, Keneti Apa, is a traditional Samoan chief and her mother, Tessa Apa, is a European New Zealander.&nbsp;He was raised alongside two older sisters.</span></p><p><span>Before starting his acting career, he went to King’s College in Auckland where he was educated.&nbsp;He grew up loving the guitar, which he still plays in his spare time, although he has no interest in pursuing a musical career yet.&nbsp;Also, he was a sports athlete who played rugby.</span></p><p><span>Another thing he loves is shooting.&nbsp;In 2017, he was involved in a minor car accident which allegedly took place while he had fallen asleep after being shot.&nbsp;Former rugby union player and coach, Michael Jones is his uncle.</span></p><p><span>KJ Apa’s first acting role came with an appearance on&nbsp;</span><span>Shortland Street</span><span>&nbsp;in 2013 as Kane Jenkins.&nbsp;After that, he got the role of Jack in 2016&nbsp;</span><span>‘s Dead</span><span>&nbsp;End, and then his real big break came when he got his role in 2017’s&nbsp;</span><span>Riverdale</span><span>&nbsp;as Archie Andrews.&nbsp;Apart from the series, he has also appeared in several films such as&nbsp;</span><span>A Dog’s Purpose</span><span>&nbsp;in 2017,&nbsp;</span><span>Altar,&nbsp;</span><span>Hatred U Give</span><span>&nbsp;in 2018 and&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Summer</span><span>&nbsp;in 2019.</span></p><p><span>The talented AJ Apa received several nominations for his role in&nbsp;</span><span>Riverdale</span><span>&nbsp;such as the Teen Choice Awards and the MTV Movie & TV Awards.&nbsp;He received the Saturn Awards for Outstanding Performance in 2017 for the same role.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>KJ Apa isn’t necessarily that actor with too many movies to his name, but thanks to a few big roles he’s starred in, the New Zealand actor has amassed quite a fortune.&nbsp;He has an estimated net worth of $3 million mostly from his acting career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Parents and girlfriend – Is he gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As already said, the actor’s father is the chief of his village, and his mother Tessa is a writer.&nbsp;She wrote and published a book, Cake, in 2011, and is also into poetry, something she always shares on her social media account.&nbsp;His parents brought the actor and his siblings to Auckland where they still live.</span></p><p><span>Living in New Zealand for the most part, KJ Apa isn’t the most confident when it comes to talking to women.&nbsp;Comparing men in the United States to those back home, the actor revealed that men in the United States are more confident and moving on has boosted his confidence.</span></p><p><span>Although some think he’s gay, it’s not like there’s any evidence to back that up.&nbsp;In fact, he revealed that because of his accent, his chances of getting a girl in the United States increased by 50%.</span></p><p><span>One of the things that is not known about him is his relationship status.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he’s been linked to a number of women in the past, including Riverdale co-star Camila Mendes.&nbsp;Regarding this, he revealed that they are just two friends, while admitting that it would be weird with someone you don’t know well, which is not the case with Mendez.</span></p><p><span>In January 2018, KJ Apa was rumored to have a girlfriend who was 16 years old at the time and hailed from Canada.&nbsp;The actor was spotted traveling to Vancouver with said girlfriend, named Corinne Isherwood.&nbsp;Other than that, they were spotted at a party with some sources claiming that the two have been dating since 2017. However, it is yet to be confirmed if they are actually dating.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>As for his height, while KJ Apa may not be the tallest man you’ll see on set, he still has a pretty good height, standing at 5ft 11in (180cm).&nbsp;In addition, Apa weighs 73 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpKFmmaCWeqm10maYoJ1dnbKqs8etZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmqJGnsq%2FA0malnqxdrLyzwMdmoKxlmJp6qK3YaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./curtis-hughes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Curtis Hughes</a>
