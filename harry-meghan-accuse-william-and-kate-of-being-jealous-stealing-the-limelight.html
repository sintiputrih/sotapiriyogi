The episode also saw the royal couple speak about how they gained enormous fame during their Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji trips.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel>Harry</a> and Meghan announced during the trip that they were expecting their first baby together. Harry claimed in the docuseries that they had to make the announcement because Meghan's baby bump was becoming visible. According to <a href=# rel>Meghan</a>'s friends, "the work they were doing [at the trip], the speeches they were giving, the people they were meeting, it seemed to be amazing." But things soon turned around for the royal couple. Lucy Fraser, one of the couple's friends, claimed, "I think Australia was the real turning point because they were so popular." Harry and Meghan's wild popularity grabbed several headlines at the time, with some even claiming they were more popular than William and Kate. However, Harry appeared to throw some subtle shade at Kate and William as he explained the then-situation.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Harry & Meghan': Ann Widdecombe accuses Meghan Markle of 'peddling conspiracy theories,' calls her 'paranoid'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Prince Harry‚Äôs like Armie freaking Hammer': Kathy Griffin on royal's Instagram romance with Meghan Markle</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/dd2a0f2c-9ad5-4ccc-a012-3a11ba6da475.png><p>A male TV representative claimed in the docuseries, addressing Meghan's fame, "She is becoming a royal rock star. Bigger, I would argue, as a couple, than William and Kate. That's probably not a good thing in the long term." The series further showed the visual of The Sun's headline saying, "Forward thinking Meghan Markle and Prince Harry top Time's most influential list but Kate Middleton and Prince William are snubbed."&nbsp;</p><p>Harry said, "The issue is when someone who is marrying in, who should be a supporting, a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than the person who is born to do this, that upsets people. It shifts the balance." The Duke of Sussex added, "You've been led to believe that the only way that your charities can succeed and the only way that your reputation can be grown or improved is if you're on the front page of the newspapers." As he said this, the camera showed Kate and Philip meeting people, seeming to imply Harry meant William when he said "the person who is born to do this."</p><p>However, things took another turn when Meghan was compared to Kate and the press started attacking the former. "The Duchess of Sussex is at war with her sister-in-law," a headline in the show read. There were comparisons between Kate and Meghan, where Meghan was condemned while Kate was praised for the same thing. Harry said, "It's the same off-shoulder dress. It's the same fruit." He added, "If you don't see the difference and understand why it's being reported that way, then I can't help you." He appeared to be hinting at internal Palace politics and his brother allegedly being responsible for it.</p><p>Harry and Meghan's thinly veiled attacks against William and Kate invited some brickbats online. "Harry and Meghan‚Äù subtly accuse William and Kate of being jealous and coordinate attacks against Meghan in the press," wrote one fan. Another questioned, "This is gonna be explosive. Harsh words and accusations. How will prince William and princess Catherine‚Äôs response be?" "So going by Harry and Meghan's logic about being on the cover of one newspaper, was the royal family mad at Kate all the times she got on the front page instead of the rest of the family?" wondered a fan. Another claimed, "The British media is ruthless and there have been racist stories about Meghan, but the constant shading of Will and Kate and the need to keep their titles from an institution that ‚Äúgaslights,‚Äù is wild."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>‚ÄúHarry and Meghan‚Äù subtly accuse William and Kate of being jealous and coordinate attacks against Meghan in the press. üî•üí•‚òÑÔ∏è<a href=#>#HarryandMeghanNetflix</a></p>‚Äî Antonello Guerrera (@antoguerrera) <a href=#>December 15, 2022</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>'Harry & Meghan' Part 2 is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
