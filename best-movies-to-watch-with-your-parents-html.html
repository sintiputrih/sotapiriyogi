However! Let me just say: #NotAllBoomers. In my experience, there are also plenty of 60-somethings who’ve done their part to help flatten the curve by practicing self-isolation and proper social distancing. Two of them are my mother and father, who were so worried about the pandemic that two months ago, they evacuated me from my studio apartment so I could spend the quarantine with them in suburban Maryland. (Everyone complains about helicopter parents until it’s the Fall of Saigon.) So now the three of us are holed up in one house for the first time since the mid-aughts, and anecdotally, it seems that plenty of other millennials are in the same boat. How should we fill the time? Perhaps with this carefully curated selection of family-friendly films currently available on streaming, as determined by me, with special assistance from my loving parents and their helpful neighbors.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck87uos5t001q3b67qzbatqqn@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Light, Low-Stress Movies</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck87upjeg001w3b67d61hjo89@published data-word-count=59>What my parents say they most want to watch right now are what I like to call “comfy” movies — films without too much stress, where the stakes stay low and ideally nobody dies.

In its rhythms, stakes, and aesthetics, Late Night occasionally feels like a two-hour episode of television, but maybe that’s what you need right now. Mindy Kaling plays a chemical-plant worker who shakes up a late-night talk show (Emma Thompson is the host) that’s grown stale. It’s all very bright and slightly too shiny, but Kaling’s script has some funny one-liners and a light-enough touch that no one’s going to feel preached at.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdrid7nq001u3h68teehlff8@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Eighth Grade" href=#>Eighth Grade</a> (available on <a data-vars-anchor-text=Amazon href=#>Amazon</a>)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckaser4zi001e3a64g1nmuwz0@published data-word-count=26>Relive your awkward teenage years through Bo Burnham’s endlessly empathetic comedy, and be thankful both you and your parents grew up before the age of Instagram.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdrif3eo000s3h68jj495xwg@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Farewell" href=#>The Farewell</a> (available on <a data-vars-anchor-text=Amazon href=#>Amazon</a>)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcm5fksb000y3h68yuebwuau@published data-word-count=61>I know what you’re thinking: a movie about a sick grandma … in this climate?

It’s a great stepping stone for getting into Bollywood cinema, because it is not just a musical, it’s a sports movie, too! It’s also 15 minutes longer than The Irishman, which is a further bonus. During the days of the British raj, a drought-stricken Indian village can’t pay its taxes (lagaan), so hunky Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) challenges the evil Brits to a cricket match. If they win, no taxes for three years. If they lose, they have to pay triple lagaan.

The amazing thing is, it actually works. Husband John Chester’s background in nature documentaries comes in handy, grounding the film in the rolling rhythms of plant and animal life. And it looks absolutely fantastic.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckdrlaq0w005b3h68rh8ugjk9@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Free Solo" href=#>Free Solo</a> (available on <a data-vars-anchor-text=Hulu href=#>Hulu</a>)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcm6xr24000r3h68x0on5fg1@published data-word-count=36>Another recent Oscar winner.

You can’t even trust the archival photographs (some of them are Photoshopped).

But if you want to take your parents on a journey into their youths, few movies are better. Constructed entirely out of footage and audio discovered in government archives, it’s not just a thrilling behind-the-scenes account of the moon landing, it’s also an immaculate time capsule that brings the world of 1969 back to stunning life.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck7gkesuj0182c5yetbolij1v@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline></span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck7xtvq8p014truyez8wc4wkd@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>You Too Can Find Love While Social Distancing</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck8ehpcv501610ey68tchrjyh@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Missing the Live-Action Mulan?
