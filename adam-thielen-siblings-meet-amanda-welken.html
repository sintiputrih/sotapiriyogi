and Randy Moss, and would wear their Vikings jerseys while practicing in his backyard as a child.</p><p>He played four sports at Detroit Lakes High School, which he attended (football, basketball, baseball, and golf).</p><p>He earned an All-conference and All-state pick in football during his senior year and assisted the Lakers in their 9-1 season.

Thielen was an undrafted free agent who was signed by the Minnesota Vikings to a three-year, $1.48 million deal on May 6, 2013.</p><p>Thielen was released by the Minnesota Vikings on August 31, 2013, along with 18 other players, as part of their final roster cuts, but the following day he was added to the practice squad.</p><p>Thielen won a place on the 53-man roster to begin the 2014 season after a good preseason showing in both offense and special teams.</p><p>On September 9, Thielen played in his first NFL game, a road contest against the St. Louis Rams. He snagged his first NFL catch in Week 5’s 42-10 road defeat for the Minnesota Vikings against the Green Bay Packers, completing the contest with four receptions for 57 yards, which was the most on the team.</p><p>After blocking Carolina Panthers punter Brad Nortman’s kick and returning the ball 30 yards to the end zone on a special teams play, he scored his first NFL touchdown and was awarded the NFC Special Teams Player of Week 13.</p><p>When the eventual Super Bowl winner Denver Broncos visited him on the road in Week 4, Thielen hauled in a career-high six catches for 70 yards.</p><p>The Vikings pulled off a fake punt during their opening drive of the regular-season finale away game against the Green Bay Packers on January 3, 2016, for the NFC North division, and Thielen gained 41 yards.</p><p>Week 5 saw Thielen start in lieu of Stefon Diggs, who was out with a groin ailment. He topped 100 receiving yards in a game against the Houston Texans for the first time in his career, finishing with seven catches for 127 yards and a score.</p><p>Thielen and the Vikings agreed to a three-year contract extension on March 15, 2017. Thielen has nine catches for 157 yards on Monday, September 11, 2017, the first game of the season against the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football.</p><p>Kirk Cousins was Thielen’s new quarterback for the 2018 campaign. With six receptions and 102 receiving yards in a 24-16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, he had a solid start to the season.</p><p>Thielen extended his deal with the Vikings on April 12, 2019, for a four-year, $64 million deal with $35 million in guaranteed pay, keeping him under contract through the 2024 campaign.</p><p>In Week 1’s 43-34 loss to the Green Bay Packers, Thielen had six catches for 110 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. Thielen hauled in eight passes for 114 yards and a score in Week 4’s 31-23 victory over the Houston Texans.</p><p>With Justin Jefferson, Thielen started the 2021 campaign as a wide receiver. He recorded nine receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns in Week 1 against the Cincinnati Bengals, which resulted in a defeat of 27-24.</p><p>On March 10, 2023, the Vikings released Thielen following the 2022 campaign. He was among the Vikings’ all-time leaders in receptions, receiving touchdowns, and receiving yards at the time of his release.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Adam Thielen have any siblings?</h2><p>Adam Thielen shares the same parents with Amanda Welken.
