The founder of the company, even though Barstool is now under new ownership, Portnoy has continued to be closely associated with the brand. The reason for that is simple, Portnoy seems to love expressing his feelings about an extremely wide array of subjects online. Not only that, <a href=#>Portnoy seems to enjoy telling the story of how he made his impressive fortune</a> and he flaunts <a href=#>how he spends his money</a> as well.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 'Call Her Daddy' Controversies Prove The Podcast Is A Magnet For Drama</a></span>Even though Dave Portnoy and Barstool Sports have become synonymous in a lot of people’s minds, there is another person who has played a huge role in the company’s success. Despite that, most people have no idea who Erika Nardini is. With that in mind, it begs two obvious questions. What does Nardini do for Barstool Sports and how much money does she make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-erika-nardini-do-for-barstool-sports>What Does Erika Nardini Do For Barstool Sports?</h2><p>When people look at what Erika Nardini has done for Barstool Sports, it is difficult to overstate how impressive her time as the company’s CEO has been. According to reports, under Erika Nardini’s stewardship, Barstool Sports went from a company with 12 employees to one where more than 600 people work. On top of that, when Nardini began working for Barstool Sports, it was a small company. According to celebritynetworth.com, Barstool Sports became so successful under Nardini’s control that Penn National Gaming paid $450 million for 36% of the company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Famous Female CEOs In The World</a></span></p><p>As Barstool Sports CEO, there are some parts of Erika Nardini’s job that are obvious to everyone. For example, Nardini often promotes the company during interviews and she has to respond to Dave Portnoy’s latest scandals. A few years ago, Erika Nardini was interviewed by Kara Goldin. During that interview, Nardini was asked what the most surprising part of being Barstool Sports’ CEO has been for her. In her response, Nardini revealed a lot about what her job for the company entails behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I just was surprised about how much we could create and how much we could do simultaneously.” While Nardini’s response to that question revealed she enjoys being creative, later in the interview she makes it pretty clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest parts of her job is fixing everyone’s problems</a>.</p><p>“It can be a grind. Everybody in your company has a problem at any given minute about multiple things, and having the stamina to work through that I think is important. I also think there’s a lot of … I like to be really involved. I think there’s CEOs who want to be distanced from their company, or they only talk to their management team, or stuff like that. I don’t really like that; I want to be really close to the people doing the most interesting things here.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what Erika Nardini said in the aforementioned interview, it seems clear her job principally consists of two things. First off, Nardini has the freedom to be creative in coming up with new opportunities for Barstool Sports which explains how she has managed to make the company so much more successful. On top of that, Nardini spends her days fixing the problems that her employees deal with.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-does-erika-nardini-make-from-barstool-sports>How Much Money Does Erika Nardini Make From Barstool Sports?</h2><p>For obvious reasons, virtually everyone has dreams of becoming rich and famous someday. As a result, it makes perfect sense that several websites report about how much money the rich and famous have. After all, it is a lot easier to fantasize about how rich a person wants to be in the future in a world where it is possible to know how much money <a href=#>the ten richest directors</a> have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Richest Living Members Of The Rothschild Family, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Due to everything that Erika Nardini has achieved in life, the website celebritynetworth.com took the time to publish an article about how much money she has. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nardini has an estimated fortune of $10 million</a> as of this writing. While it is fascinating to know that figure, that doesn’t provide an answer to the question, how much is Nardini’s current Barstool Sports salary.</p><p>Unfortunately, the two most credible websites about the fortunes of the rich and famous, Forbes and celebritynetworth, haven’t reported anything about Erika Nardini’s annual salary. However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t any reports about Nardini’s current salary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to several different websites, Erika Nardini’s current annual salary is more than $600,000. For example, the website comparably.com which reports on the money that executives for various companies make says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barstool Sports' highest-paid employee makes $600,000 a year</a>.

On top of that, glamourpath.com also reports that Nardini gets paid $600,000 a year.
