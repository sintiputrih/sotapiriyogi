But as a current resident of Los Angeles, Von is still holding on to his Louisiana roots. After touring the country extensively for over a decade and earning spots on Comedy Central, TBS, <i>Last Comic Standing</i>, and CollegeHumor, Von returned to Louisiana last year to film his one hour Netflix special, <i>No Offense,</i> at New Orleans’ Civic Theatre. In his lingering drawl Von told me, “It’s cool that I get to mention my hometown. I get to say, ‘Covington, Louisiana,’ during the special. To me that truly meant the world.” I talked to Von about the new special (which premieres today), his self proclaimed white trash upbringing, and what it’s like to go into debt to pursue your creative dream.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5eg06rxgu8468vkohs8@published data-word-count=23><b>As a kid coming up in Covington did you ever think you would have a shot at doing anything in the entertainment industry?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5eg06rygu84rb81n8cq@published data-word-count=45>Not when I was young, I don’t think.

I saw my first comedian in Baton Rouge. I liked it and decided to start talking about stuff. Eventually I said, “I’ve got to let go of the reality TV stuff and focus on this job. I think I have a talent, so I’m going to try to do the hardest thing.” People always say that standup comedy is the hardest thing. It took about nine or ten years before people stopped judging me from reality TV and really started to recognize me as a comedian. I don’t know if you’re ever fully a comedian because you’re always learning, seeing people better than you and striving to get better. I’ve been out there touring now for 10 to 12 years, at least 25 weeks a year. I think the most I ever did was 40. I do feel like I’ve put in my work to substantiate any accolades I’ve been given.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5eg06s7gu84jro1uaiw@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5eg06s8gu848n25umk5@published data-word-count=18><b>You said the first comedian you ever saw was in Baton Rouge.

But when did I feel like I finally kind of… you know, there have been some different things. Like I did a Half Hour with Comedy Central a few years ago. But when I got passed as a paid regular at the Comedy Store out in California, that really meant a lot.

But that’s not weird. People make things weird. It’s too much. I think we’re starting to see a little bit of a swing back though… people speaking their minds. That’s something I’ve embraced the past couple of years. I just say, “Fuck that. I’m going to be myself.” I’m going to talk the way I talk. I know I’m a loving person.
