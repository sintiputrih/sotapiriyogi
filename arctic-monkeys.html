The lyrics start with the observation that the industry has "sped up to the point where they provoke/The punchline before they have told the joke." This is a metaphor for the way that everything in the entertainment industry is sped up and pushed out, often without much thought or quality. The desperation to be seen is palpable, as people stare at their television screens looking for meaning.</p><br><p>The lyrics then go on to argue that this cheap, fast-paced entertainment is not worth anyone's time. When people get excited about something that turns out to be dull or uninteresting, the song seems to say, they only have themselves to blame. They were "dying" for it, and the industry was only too happy to oblige.</p><br><p>Later in the song, the lyrics delve more specifically into the music industry, with the line "The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means." The implication here is that young people are sold an impossible dream, that success in the music industry is something that can be achieved if only they work hard enough. The song suggests that this is a lie, and that the industry doesn't care about its artists at all.</p><br><p>Overall, "Teddy Picker" paints a bleak picture of the entertainment industry and its audiences, arguing that both are complicit in perpetuating a shallow, meaningless culture.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>They've sped up to the point where they provoke</u><br>The entertainment industry has become so fast-paced that it tries to elicit a reaction before even delivering the content</p><br><p><u>The punchline before they have told the joke</u><br>Media entities often try to sensationalize content, even if it means revealing the most important parts of it beforehand</p><br><p><u>Plenty of desperation to be seen</u><br>There is a sense of urgency and desperation to grab people's attention, even if it means resorting to cheap tactics</p><br><p><u>Staring at the television screen</u><br>People are glued to their screens, consuming content that is often contrived and manipulative</p><br><p><u>You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke</u><br>The media wants you to react to their content before they've even delivered it, and it's frustrating</p><br><p><u>Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist</u><br>Sorry, but the hype that the media builds up is often unfounded</p><br><p><u>It wasn't in the Top 100 list</u><br>The media's idea of 'good content' is often shaped by their own narrow-minded interests and biases</p><br><p><u>And it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder</u><br>The media keeps repeating the same pattern of overhyping and underdelivering</p><br><p><u>Don't be surprised when you get bent over</u><br>Don't be surprised when the media tricks you again and again, using cheap tactics to grab your attention</p><br><p><u>They told ya, but you were dying for it</u><br>The media often gives you hints about what they're going to do next, but you're so hooked that you still fall for it</p><br><p><u>saw it and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed</u><br>People's dreams and aspirations are often built around the false promises of the media, which are later revealed to be hollow</p><br><p><u>The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means</u><br>People aspire to success without necessarily knowing what that success means or entails</p><br><p><u>Another variation on a theme</u><br>The media often rehashes the same ideas and concepts, repackaging them to make them appear new</p><br><p><u>A tangle on the television and the magazine</u><br>The media is a web of interconnected content, but it's often repetitive and shallow</p><br><p><u>Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?</u><br>Do the media create content that's meant to be humorous, or are they just playing with people's emotions?</p><br><p><u>Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath</u><br>Do media entities force people to conform to their narrow definition of 'good content'?</p><br><p><u>That says that we are defenders</u><br>The media often claims to be the protectors of people's interests, even if that's far from the truth</p><br><p><u>Of any poseur or professional pretender around</u><br>The media goes after people who are seen as fake or insincere, even if the media itself is also guilty of those same things</p><br><p><u>When did your list replace the twist and turn</u><br>When did the media's definition of what's good and bad replace people's ability to form their own opinions?</p><br><p><u>Like a fist replaced the kiss?</u><br>Has the media's emphasis on sensationalism replaced nuanced and thoughtful content?</p><br><p><u>Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer</u><br>Don't waste your time trying to sell me nonsense or any other trivial thing.
