Manning has not yet taken the field for the Texas Longhorns, despite the high expectations placed on him and the expectation that he would pl ay in his rookie season.</p><p>Although some supporters might be curious about where he might start the following season, Arch’s grandfather, Archie Manning, has said that Arch is pleased with his choice to join Texas.</p><p>The elder Manning noted that each circumstance is unique and underlined how crucial it is for Arch to receive a redshirt this year in order to keep his eligibility and possibly play a bigger part for the team in the upcoming season.</p><p>The success of the team as a whole and the play of Quinn Ewers and Maalik Murphy, the team’s current starting quarterbacks, could influence Arch Manning’s decision to leave Texas. Manning might have a chance to start the following season if Ewers were to depart after this one, but that is still up in the air. According to Archie Manning, Arch is happy with his decision and will receive a redshirt this year, implying that, for the time being at least, he has no intention of leaving Texas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Arch Manning?</h2><p>Born on April 27, 2005, Archibald Charles “Arch” Manning plays quarterback for the Texas Longhorns in American football. He belongs to the Manning family. Being the first quarterback to start Newman’s season opener in at least 40 years, Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback during his rookie year.</p><p>He had an outstanding debut, helping Newman win by a score of 26 points. With 2,407 yards and 34 touchdowns at the end of his rookie campaign, Peyton Manning was named MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year.</p><p>At East Jefferson High School, Manning scored six touchdowns passing against David Guillot’s defense to start his sophomore campaign. He threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more in his national television debut on October 15, 2020, against Booker T. Washingt on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Manning’s family declined early offers of a college scholarship as well as interviews with the media in order to prevent a media frenzy. Only friends and coaches, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, were able to follow him on his private Instagram account.</p><p>A local media representative stated, “They’ve shut down everything, but the attention is going to come.” During his college search, he made visits to Ole Miss, the old team of his father, uncle, and grandfather, as well as SMU, Clemson, LSU, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and Virginia. When he committed to Texas on June 23, 2022, he made his account public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Isn’t Arch Manning Playing for Texas Football?</h2><p>It looks like the coaching staff made a calculated decision to keep Arch Manning off the field this season in order to protect his redshirt. Manning can still play as a redshirt freshman in 2019 and participate in up to four games, but the coaching staff appears hesitant to use him right away.</p><p>Manning’s playing time has been scarce because redshirt freshman Maalik Murphy and starting quarterback Quinn Ewers are both coming back from injuries. Manning may have to wait for his turn to start quarterback for the Longhorns due to coaching decisions and the fact that Ewers will be eligible for two more seasons after this one.</p><p>In the long run, it doesn’t appear like Arch Manning will be transferring from Texas anytime soon. Even though there are a lot of unknowns going forward, such as Ewers’ draft choices and Murphy’s competition, Archie Manning, the grandfather of Manning, has made it clear that his grandson Arch is happy with his choice to play for the Texas Longhorns.</p><p>There appears to be a plan in place for Manning’s development within the team, even if it involves waiting for the ideal moment to demonstrate his abilities on the field. This is evident in the redshirt strategy and the belief that Manning will benefit from this approach.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Arch Manning Leaving Texas? – FAQs</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Arch Manning leaving Texas?</h2><p>There’s no concrete evidence as of yet that Arch Manning is moving out of Texas.
