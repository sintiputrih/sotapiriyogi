But it wasn’t until they later ran into each other in Paris in 2018, the two started dating.</span></p><p><span>Ivy recalled, “I saw this cute guy who was taking photos of the event and me, I naturally went over, and we started talking.”</span></p><p><span>After two years, Tobias then proposed to Ivy while holidaying on the Italian island of Capri. “He proposed in Capri, in a spot overlooking the whole island, with his mother’s vintage engagement ring,” Capri shared.</span></p><p><span>The ring looked similar to that of Princess Diana’s ring — a sapphire on a yellow gold band.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic was at its peak then. And with Ivy losing both her grandmother Ann (interior designer and philanthropist who raised her) and her father John Gilbert Getty, their wedding plans were on hold then.</span></p><p><span>Finally, on November 7, 2021, the two tied the knot at the City Hall in San Francisco</span></p><p><span>Their wedding was attended by members of Ivy’s family, including her aunt Vanessa Getty and her first cousin, transgender model, and activist Nats Getty. Also, notable guests like Wes Gordon, Mimi Wade, Marta Mae, Petite Meller, Hamish Bowles, Marsha Molinari, Laura Hanson Sims, and several others made it to the A-list event.</span></p><p><span>Besides their grand wedding, the eyes of guests were also set on Ivy’s gown made of broken mirrors. Yes, actual mirrors! It was custom-made by John Galliano.</span></p><p><span>Before their wedding, the couple also held a prewedding party at San Fransisco’s City Hall on October 7. The part theme was “Mod”, and each guest took that challenge with the utmost seriousness.</span></p><h3><b>Tobias Engel Age</b></h3><p><span>Tobias Engel was 28 years of age when he married Ivy in November 2021.</span></p><p><span>He is three years older than Ivy who was born on December 20, 1994.</span></p><h3><b>Tobias Engel Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>An aspiring film director, Tobias is a tech entrepreneur and a photographer based in London.

Paul became the richest man in the world after consolidating his empire in the U.S. and then striking an impressive oil deal with Saudi Arabia in the 1960s and 70s.</span></p><p><span>Besides her inheritance, Ivy made her own money working as an artist and model.
