I also have a link to a free download for your Goddess Journal or Grimoire.</p><h2>Who is the Goddess Bastet?</h2><p>Bastet is the daughter of the Sun God Ra, and the moon goddess, Isis (although her mother is sometimes said to be the Distant Goddess). Her name is also translated as B'sst, Baast, Ubaste, and Baset.</p><p>Originally a fierce warrior, often depicted as a lioness, Bastet later became known as the cat goddess, which is the image we have of her today.</p><p>Represented by a cat, or sometimes a woman with a cat’s head, Bastet’s reputation softened from her warrior beginnings.</p><p>A protector of the home, domesticity, and of course, cats, Bastet is also known for keeping the home free from evil spirits.</p><p>Women and children are her domain, and she is thought to have the ability to protect both from disease and illness. &nbsp;Originally known as ‘Bast’, she later became known as ‘Bastet’; the feminine suffix being added, it is thought, to emphasize the ‘t’ sound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/1777b465-797f-4f6a-963c-cfa69f697437/239px-Bastet.svg.png><h2>What is the Sistrum?</h2><p>Bastet is usually depicted holding a breastplate known as an aegis in her left hand, and a sistrum in her right. The sistrum was a percussion instrument used in ancient Egypt at religious ceremonies and is also associated with music and dance.</p><p>As Bastet is known as the goddess of music, dance, and celebration, it makes sense that she would be holding such an instrument.</p><p>The sistrum was believed to hold magical powers, emitting the same frequency as the Universe, and can be used in your sacred space to stir up energy. Alternatively, gentler shaking will dampen frenetic energy to a more manageable level.</p><p>The term ‘sistrum’ comes from the Greek ‘seistron’, meaning ‘that which is shaken’, and one Egyptian term for the instrument is sekhem, which means power. However, by far the most interesting word for the sistrum is ‘sesheshet’, an onomatopoeia word that produces the sound it describes.</p><p>This traditional Sistrum is made in Ghana and uses recycled bottle caps. A great addition to your altar space.</p><h2>Why Worship or Honor Her?</h2><p>There are many reasons why you might honor or worship Bastet.</p><p>As the goddess of protection, you can call upon her to protect your home and family and to keep disease and illness from affecting the women and children in your life. She is also connected to fertility, so is a wonderful deity to turn to when trying for a baby, or to keep a pregnancy healthy.</p><p>Alongside her role in fertility, Bastet is also the goddess of love and sex, so honoring her can deepen a physical and emotional relationship. In fact, one of her names was Pasht, which of course forms the root of the word ‘passion’.</p><p>Those with links to the fire service might be interested to know that Bastet is also the patron goddess of firefighters. In Ancient Egypt it was believed that if a cat ran through a burning building, it would draw the flames out. Worshipping her is a powerful way to keep a firefighter safe as they work.</p><p>Of course, she is best known for her role as a cat goddess, so she is the perfect deity to work with and worship if you are a cat lover. Whether you own cats, have a cat as a familiar, or work in a shelter, Bastet will watch over your feline charges and keep them safe.</p><h2>How Does She Connect With Cat Lovers?</h2><p>Many pagans will work with a deity that they feel connected to, but how do you know that Bastet is calling you? It can be difficult to recognize the signs, especially if you are new to working with deities, but there are some definite indicators that you can learn to recognize, once you know what you are looking for.</p><p>As Bastet is the cat goddess, the most obvious sign that she’s connecting with you is the presence of cats, literally or figuratively. For instance, you might find that you are followed by cats, that you find a stray that feels like ‘yours’, or that you see cats wherever you go.</p><p>There might be cats around in less obvious forms, too. The page of a book opens at a picture or section on cats, for example, or maybe somebody gives you a piece of jewelry with a feline image.</p><p>There could be less obvious signs, too. You might just ‘feel’ her presence around you, or hear a meowling that doesn’t belong. Dreams are also a common way for deities to reach you, so pay attention to what you dream about, and keep a dream diary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/2f53a746-2cb6-4529-b110-832b0170172f/pixie+on+altar.jpg><h2>Bastet AltAr</h2><p>One of the best ways to honor Bastet when she has called to you is by <a href=#>making her an altar</a>. This can be your existing altar or additional space that is dedicated solely to her. A small shelf, table, or even a windowsill will work beautifully.</p><p>What you place on your altar is up to you, and you should choose what you are drawn to, but here are some ideas to get you started:</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Bastet statue. A representation of Bastet should take center stage on the altar, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a true likeness. You could use a cat statue, for example, or even print out a picture and frame it.</p></li><li><p>Candles. As Bastet was the daughter of Ra, the Sun God, <a href=#>candles in corresponding colors</a> make excellent altar ware. Choose them in colors such as reds, oranges, or yellows, or if you don’t have those colors to hand, use a white candle. Bastet is closely linked to the home and domesticity, so a white candle can represent clean linen.</p></li><li><p>Incense holder. Incense works twofold on an altar. It is a fragrant way to cleanse the sacred space, and it can also act as an offering.</p></li><li><p>Herbs. Catmint of course as well as rose, lemon balm, and honeysuckle.</p></li><li><p>Wine glass. If you intend to make offerings to Bastet, you might need a vessel in which to do it. A spare wine glass, bowl, or even a cup will suffice.</p></li><li><p>Symbols. Draw or buy items with symbols that are often associated with Bastet. A sistrum would make a good addition, as would <a href=#>the Eye of Ra</a>.</p></li><li><p>Crystals. <a href=#>Adding crystals</a> will intensify the energy of any altar, so add some in sun-related colors, such as citrine, garnet, and carnelian. You could also add <a href=#>black tourmaline</a> for protection. Legend has it that the goddess’ menstrual blood turned to turquoise as it fell, so that would be a fitting tribute, too. Torquoise also has a peaceful energy that appeals to Bast.</p></li><li><p>Music. Bastet loves music and appreciates bells and rattles.</p></li></ul><p>Before setting up your altar you should ritually cleanse it. <a href=#>Smoke cleansing </a>is a fabulous way to do this, using an herb bundle or incense. If you cannot use smoke, however, wiping down the surfaces with moon water is just as effective.</p><p>Check out my Bastet Video on YouTube</p><h2>Bastet Offerings</h2><p>Now you have your altar all set up, you can use it to meditate, honor, or call upon the Cat Goddess. If you want to truly curry favor with her, though, bringing offerings is a significant mark of respect. Again you should go with your instinct, but the following ideas might help:</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Wine. Bastet loves a celebration, so an offering of wine can be made in the glass we mentioned above.</p></li><li><p>Perfume. Bastet is also known as the Perfumed Protector – her name shares a hieroglyph with a ‘bas’ jar, a heavy jar that held expensive perfumes. Spraying or sprinkling perfume on the altar will please the goddess greatly.</p></li><li><p>Catnip. As the Cat Goddess, Bastet will appreciate an offering of catnip. For extra meaning, try growing your own, harvesting it, and offering it to her when you need her help.</p></li><li><p>Sweet Foods. If you are seeking Bastet’s help with fertility, or anything to do with pregnancy and childbirth, chocolate and/or honey make appropriate gifts.</p></li><li><p>Meat. Bastet the hunter appreciates meat, especially chicken and fish.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/07596551-0303-4395-a049-560840c81208/Candle+Magic+Course.png><h2>Music and Dancing</h2><p>One of the best ways to honor Bastet is through music and dance. In fact, the Bast Festival, which was held in Ancient Egypt to celebrate the goddess, was a riot of music, movement, and merry-making. Said to be attended by more than seven hundred thousand people, her festival was certainly one of the most popular.</p><p>During this event, women would dance and sing, and participate in a ritual known as the lifting of the skirts; essentially displaying their genitalia for all to see. Whether this was to represent women breaking free of restraints, or (as other sources suggest) to celebrate their fertility, is not truly known.</p><p>In keeping with her love of dancing and music, you could sing your petition to Bastet at her altar, and even incorporate dancing as you sing or chant the words.</p><p>A dinner party for friends and family could also be thrown in her honor as a way of including her in your celebrations.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Hymn To Bastet</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;<strong>Mother of the Gods, the One, the Only,</strong></p><p><strong>Mistress of the Crowns, You rule all.</strong></p><p><strong>Bast, Beloved, when Your people call</strong></p><p><strong>Daughter of the Sun, with flame and fury,</strong></p><p><strong>Flashing from the prow upon the foe;</strong></p><p><strong>Safely sails the boat with Your protection</strong></p><p><strong>Passing scatheless where Your fires glow.</strong></p><p><strong>Daughter of the Sun, the burial chamber</strong></p><p><strong>Lies in the darkness ‘til Your light appears.</strong></p><p><strong>From Your Throne of Silence send us comfort,</strong></p><p><strong>Bast, beloved, banish all our fears.</strong></p><p><strong>Mother of the Gods,</strong></p><p><strong>No gods existed ‘til You came there and gave them life.</strong></p><p><strong>Trampling down all evil and all strife.</strong></p><p><strong>Mother of the Gods, the Great, the Loved One,</strong></p><p><strong>Winged and Mighty, unto You we call,</strong></p><p><strong>Naming You the Comforter, the Ruler,</strong></p><p><strong>Bast, beloved, Mother of us all</strong></p><p>Exerpt from <a href=#>Margaret Murray</a>. Egyptian Religious Poetry. (John Murray Publishers, 1949), 103</p><p>When looking for signs that Bastet is calling you, learn to be present and look around you. Take notice of the signs she may be sending to you, and accept each one graciously. Learn as much as you can about her, talk to her, and listen to what she might be telling you.</p><h3><strong>Take Away</strong></h3><p>Working with any deity is simply a relationship, and like all relationships, it needs to be nurtured. Take some of the ideas mentioned here, and begin a partnership with Bastet that can enhance your life in immeasurable ways.</p><p><strong>Our Founder, Ame Vanorio</strong>, is a lifelong pagan, an <a href=#>environmental educator,</a> and a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.
