What is Her Age Height and Weight ?</h1><div id=sub-header>March 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Pamibaby is a well-known Tik Tok star and all-around social media influencer who possesses exceptional singing and dancing abilities and has won the hearts of millions of fans with her lip sync and dancing videos. Pamibaby is only 23 years old and stands 5 feet 5 inches tall, but she has accomplished a lot in her career.</p><p>She is also well known for her beauty and makeup content, with her video having received over 170 million views. The Tik Tok star has since expanded her reach to other social media platforms and is now dabbling in the music industry.</p><h2>Pamibaby Height, Weight, And Age</h2><p>Pamibaby is 23 years old, having been born on May 9, 2000. The Tik Tok star has not revealed any information about her educational background, but she is clearly well-educated. Given her current age of 23, she is most likely in college and pursuing a degree, but she may have decided to stop at a high school diploma and focus on her burgeoning social media career.</p><p>Pamibaby stands 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 meters) tall and weighs 55 kg. This results in a slim build that complements her attractive features nicely. Among these lovely features is her luxuriant brown hair, which she usually wears in a shoulder-length bob. She also has lovely brown eyes and plump lips.</p><p>Pamibaby is skilled at applying makeup, which enhances her beauty. She, on the other hand, looks stunning even without it. Pamibaby’s height of 5 feet 5 inches places her in the middle of the pack when compared to other female influencers, such as fellow members of the Not a Content House Collective.</p><p>Pamibaby is 5 feet 5 inches tall, which makes her shorter than three of the members: Cynthia Parker (5 feet 6 inches), Madi Monroe (5 feet 8 inches), and Anna Shumate (5 feet 6 inches). She is, however, taller than two other members, Lauren Kettering (5 feet 3 inches) and Sabrina Quesada (5 feet 3 inches). Pamibaby is exactly the same height as Eva Cudmore, another member of Not a Content House, who is also 5 feet 5 inches tall.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Butterfly-Locs-Copy-Copy-1-1-300x300.jpg alt=Pamibaby width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Pamibaby Biography</h2><p>Pamibaby is a native of the United Arab Emirates. She was born in the year 2000 in the city of Dubai. Her family moved to the United States of America, specifically Houston, Texas, in 2014, after spending the first 14 years of her life there.</p><p>Given the conservative nature of the UAE and the more liberal nature of the US, the cultural clash must have been something else for the young lady. However, given her age, she would have found it easier to integrate. Aside from the implications of cultural clashes, Pamibaby now has Emirati and possibly American ancestors.</p><h2>Pamibaby’s Nationality</h2><p>Pamibaby is of Bulgarian (European Caucasian) and Middle Eastern descent. Her parents are said to be from Bulgaria and the Middle East. Unfortunately, no other information about Pamibaby’s parents or other family members exists aside from their nationalities.</p><p>The names and occupations of her parents are unknown. It is also unknown whether she has siblings. We anticipate that this information will eventually make its way into the public domain.</p><h2>Pamibaby in social media</h2><p>TikTok has over 7.3 million followers. Instagram has over 1.9 million followers. YouTube has over 199k subscribers. Pamibaby has released a number of songs on Spotify.

It featured her enticing vocals on a catchy chorus, and she revealed that she had enjoyed working on the song and would like to do more in the future.</p><p>Pamibaby has since kept her word. A visit to her Spotify page will reveal four songs, including Falling, Tell Me, and Without You, which she produced herself. She has about 51,335 monthly listeners, which is not bad for a new artist.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Butterfly-Locs-Copy-Copy-1-300x300.jpg alt=Pamibaby width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Pamibaby’s Net Worth</h2><p>Pamibaby has a net worth of $300,000, with her success as a social media influencer being the primary source of her wealth.
