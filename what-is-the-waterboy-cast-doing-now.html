id=sub-header>March 2024 · 9 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p data-characters=117 data-injectable=true data-video=true>As<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Adam Sandler</a></strong> released another sports-themed movie with him at the helm, it reminds us of the others from his past.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>As Hustle keeps netting high marks with audiences and the media, it follows on Sandler’s love affair with sports and his ability to find an underdog story that everyone can root for in the arena of sports, even if they’re not quite sports movies.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>After he got the sports thing started with Happy Gilmore (in which he was a one-time hockey player who became a golfer), The Waterboy followed next in 1998, and is still in the upper ranks as one of the most quotable ‘90s (and Sandler) movies.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>The Waterboy is still in the top 10 all-time for highest-grossing sports movies at number nine, and looking at the eight above it, we can reasonably say that The Waterboy is the highest-grossing sports comedy movie of all time.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Just look at the other eight on this list — four are Fast & Furious franchise movies, two are cartoons in Cars and the sequel Cars 2, and then you have Forrest Gump, which we can’t fathom being in the “sports comedy” category. This leaves The Blind Side which, again, isn’t really a comedy even if it has some laughs.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>That puts The Waterboy atop the sports comedy list at a lifetime gross of $161,491,646 as of June 2020. Funny thing is another Sandler sports comedy, the remake of The Longest Yard, is just behind it in 10th (or second, for our sports comedy purposes) at $158,119,460.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Is it any wonder Sandler’s sports comedies largely work, and even stand as films audiences (especially fans of Sandler and/or sports) still hold in high regard?</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The Waterboy takes a similar approach with some twists. It’s another down-on-his-luck character (like Happy Gilmore, albeit a totally different person) who finds meaning and friendship (and kinship) through sports. The Waterboy follows Sandler’s lead character as he goes from being a disregarded (and even discarded) waterboy who then by a twist of fate becomes a breakout college football player with a smorgasbord of hilarious costars by his side.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>On the verge of its 25th anniversary next year, there’s a lot to look back on with who was involved (there were actually a lot of recognizable names).</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Where are they now? Let’s look at what The Waterboy cast is doing now.</p><h3 id=h-adam-sandler-bobby-boucher data-injectable=false><strong>Adam Sandler — Bobby Boucher</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>As you might have heard or had pop up on your Netflix browsing lists (you know they love to drop those repeat titles), Sandler has a new sports movie out called Hustle.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Not quite in the comedy vein as his previous sports enterprises — but one with more of a heart and adult real-world environment compared to the zany, fish-out-of-water experiences in Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy — Hustle shows that Sandler + sports is usually a formula that equals goodness on some level.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Sandler is slated to continue putting out new work, drama and comedy (and ridiculous) over the next few years as his partnership with Netflix continues.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>There are even some sequels on the way that maybe nobody asked for, but the numbers must say otherwise, with Murder Mystery 2 in the works as one of them.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>He’s already taken on hockey, golf, football, and now basketball. So, a baseball movie must in the works somewhere, yeah?</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Henry Winkler — Coach Klein</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Probably the next star from the movie that’s remained in our current watching culture, Winkler is doing wonders as the former actor/acting teacher/actor once again costar of Barry.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>The HBO Max series just wrapped up its third season in which Winkler puts forth an emotional performance that will engulf your senses and have you feeling his every pain and consideration right with him.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoiler for the </strong><strong>Barry</strong><strong> season three finale in the next two paragraphs</strong>!!!</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>The barely noticeable look of satisfaction he gives when Barry is arrested in the season three finale — all while still showing with only facial acting how incredibly somber and depressed he remains from the loss of the love of his life — is something that Winkler pulls off masterfully.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>We love that Winkler went from heartthrob The Fonz on Happy Days to span such an extensive career and has allowed himself to be whatever and whoever he wants to be, not weighed down by such a historic character performance.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Kathy Bates — Helen Boucher</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-159833664-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>The wondrous and prolific Bates has continued to put in great work in a film almost every year like clockwork (sometimes a few in one year, other times a small gap) since The Waterboy.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>From funny to panic-inducing, charming to crass, Bates has shown the full range and then some throughout her tremendous career.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Most recently she gained critical acclaim for her roles in American Horror Story: Apocalypse in 2018, and then The Highwaymen and Richard Jewell, which were both released in 2019.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>She appeared in 2020’s Home, but has since not been on the big screen in the last couple of years (as is the case with plenty of talent during the COVID-19 pandemic).</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Next year she will play Sylvia Simon, the grandmother to the titular character in 2023’s Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>“Kathy Bates has given us so many memorable, iconic characters,” writer and director Kelly Fremon Craig told <a href=#>Deadline</a> upon the announcement. “Whether it’s comedy or drama, she is perpetually captivating on-screen. I’m thrilled to employ her extraordinary talents on this film I care so much about.”</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Following that, she is cast to take part in The Miracle Club, which is meant to be a British-Irish comedy costarring Maggie Smith and Laura Linney, but the film is without a release date as of yet.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Rob Schneider — The Townie</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Never afraid to poke fun at himself or go way over the top looking for laughs, we last saw Schneider in two other Sandler projects on Netflix — The Wrong Missy and Hubie Halloween.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>And you know when Sandler asks Schneider a question about trying something, his longtime pal is gonna tell him he can do it! (OK, probably not, but that four-word phrase, “You can do it!” has sure lived on a longtime.)</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=118 data-injectable=false>Let’s just look at who Schneider played in Hubie Halloween, which got bigger numbers on Netflix than you’d expect.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Schneider plays Richie Hartman, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as explained amazingly on Wikipedia</a> he’s “Hubie’s childhood friend and a convict with severe bladder issues who escaped from a mental institution to get his roommate back there before he gets into trouble.”</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>That’s devotion to making any side or bit character come to life.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>There’s certainly no shame being in the Sandlerverse as the Sandman is known to take great care of those around him, and to work as a collaborator more than a boss.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>He was also on The Masked Singer just last year, and had a role in the 2022 sports comedy that also came from Happy Madison Productions (Sandler’s company) called Home Team, starring Kevin James (another member of the Sandlerverse).</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Jerry Reed — Coach Red Beaulieu</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The antagonist coach who doubts and pushes Bobby Boucher, Jerry Reed put on a great and believable performance as the coach of a football team in the south.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>After several memorable performances throughout a long career, including in Gator and Smokey and the Bandit, The Waterboy was Reed’s final on-screen performance.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Many might not know that he was a noted musician as well, with several signature songs that appeared in several places (including “East Bound and Down” for Smokey and the Bandit).</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Reed, who has been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, passed away in 2008.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Fairuza Balk — Vicki Vallencourt</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-51096560-e1655921243513.jpg><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>The rebellious love interest for Boucher in the film, Balk has continued to make a mark on the screen.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Currently she’s part of the big ensemble cast of the TV series Paradise City on Amazon Prime that debuted in 2021 and has been renewed for a second season already.
