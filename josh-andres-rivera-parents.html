Let’s explore the meanings behind each of the actor’s unique distinctive tattoos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Idris Elba has ‘The Black Star of Ghana’ Tattoo on His Hand</h2><p>Idris chose to imprint ‘The Black Star of Ghana’ on the back of his right hand. He enthusiastically shared a snapshot of his inked masterpiece on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a> on December 2, 2013, with the playful caption, “Showing off my tattoo. Hope you don’t mind.”</p><p>Following the post, a wave of curiosity swept through the actor’s devoted fan base.
