The English bloke has been around for a while, showcasing his acting chops in various genres. His credits include several short films, including <i>About a Dog, Second Skin,</i> and his debut, <i>Beneath Water</i>. The rising actor started garnering gradual attention for portraying Lord Tewkesbury in the Netflix film <i>Enola Holmes</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on June 3, 2003, in Wandsworth, London, Partridge professionally ventured into acting at 11. The budding actor is undoubtedly years and roles away from growing to his full potential, but that isn't stopping Louis from sparking a little headline on his love life. Ahead is everything you need to know about Partridge's headline-inducing dating life. &nbsp;</p><h2>Is Louis Partridge Dating Olivia Rodrigo? &nbsp;</h2><p>If the recent news about Partridge's new rumored interest is accurate, then the <i>Enola Holmes</i> actor has scored a big one. According to various sources, Louis is dating singer-songwriter <strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong>, the three-time Grammy-winning Gen-Z pop icon and the crooner of the trendiest hits like <i>Driver License, Deja Vu,</i> and <i>Good 4 U. &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/2/283443517_351275677102439_8236686128764450055_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701531514487.jpg><p>It might be too early to determine where things are headed for the two 20-year-olds, but it's undoubtedly somewhere romantic. Partridge and Rodrigo first sparked dating rumors in late October after being photographed strolling in London's streets. An insider later reported that the <i>Driver's License</i> hitmaker flew to Partridge's home city with her best pal, singer <strong>Conan Gray. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although several sources concurred that the pair are in the beginning stage of their relationship, some have called the two inseparable. "They met through mutual pals earlier in the year and have been messaging quite a bit," a source said, <a href=#>adding,</a> "She has spent a few days in the capital hanging out with them all, but it's Louis who she has been inseparable from." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/2/401624625_1413224899275412_7882507002473211052_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701531521098.jpg><p>While it is the first high-profile dating experience for the <i>Enola Holmes </i>actor, Rodrigo has navigated a couple of well-known romances before. The Grammy winner, whose melancholic lyrics earned her the title of breakup anthem queen, sparked dating rumors with music producer <strong>Zack Bia</strong> in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rodrigo reportedly flew to London to meet the 'Enola Holmes' actor!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>In recent years, since her dramatic emergence in the music industry, Rodrigo has dated actor <strong>Adam Faze </strong>and her <i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i> co-star,<strong> Joshua Bassett</strong>, a relationship which allegedly spawned her hitmaker, <i>Driver's License</i>. Partridge and Rodrigo have not confirmed their budding romance, but despite this, fans are already shipping the attractive duo. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Louis Partridge has Been in Love Before! &nbsp;</h3><p>Partridge is undoubtedly new to dating in the limelight, but this isn't the first time the actor's love life has sparked some discussion. As his alleged relationship with Rodrigo continues to garner an inundated amount of notice, let us remind you of his recently dissolved romance with actress<strong> Sydney Chandler, </strong>best known as the daughter of actor<strong> Kyle Chandler. &nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/2/318339617_703943854340135_1568559573304919545_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701531569770.jpg><p>Partridge and Chandler reportedly met on the sets of <strong>Craig Pearce</strong>-created FX/Hulu miniseries <i>Pistol</i>, which also starred <strong>Toby Wallace</strong> and <strong>Jacob Slater</strong>. Reports of the duo's alleged romance surfaced after the series release last year. Partridge and Chandler's relationship seemingly started on the sets of Pistol and went on for about a year. &nbsp;</p><p>While keeping things under the radar, the <i>Enola Holmes</i> actor even jetted out to Italy to support Sydney at the premiere of <strong>Olivia </strong>Wilde's directed <i>Don't Worry Darling</i> at the Venice Film Festival. "They seem very close to going public with their relationship, and Louis played the role of the supportive boyfriend very well," said an insider. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/2/283494547_335890365340886_1336386950168764849_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701531552049.jpg><p>Partridge and Chandler have since called off their romance, but fans weren't thrilled when they were an item, mainly because of their significant age gap. The <i>Paddington 2 </i>actor was reportedly seventeen when he and Chandler, who was 25 at the time, struck a romance. Some enraged fans even went as far as calling out Kyle for "grooming" the young Brit. &nbsp;</p><p>While a small faction of fans defended the duo's pairing, arguing that no one would have been bothered if the roles were reversed, most couldn't wrap their head around an older woman dating a young man. Since the pair never officially confirmed their romantic link, they didn't announce their breakup either. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/2/313895994_1163301481286913_5311586249642788936_n%20(1)%20(1)-1701531583929.jpg><p>The news of the duo's alleged breakup got out earlier this year after a TikTok video divulged that the Brit and his reported flame of a year were no longer together. Partridge was briefly linked with his onscreen love interest, <strong>Millie Bobby Brown,</strong> with whom he starred in <i>Enola Holmes.</i> The pair's rumored love was debunked after Brown made her relationship with Jake Bongiovi official. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqtu9SiqmaokafBs7XDoJysZZeev62y0aKcp5xdlnqouMimp6ydXZ67tbuMrZ%2BeoaJiv6a4wK2gqKajnbax</p></div><div id=links><a href=./amber-riley-net-worth-209723.html>&#171;&nbsp;Amber Riley Net Worth</a>
