The tragic truth behind Cynthias husband</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Ginny and Georgia is a popular Netflix series that follows the lives of a mother-daughter duo, Georgia and Ginny, who move to a small town in New England after Georgia’s husband dies. The show explores the themes of family, friendship, romance, identity, and secrets, as well as the challenges that both Georgia and Ginny face in their new environment.</p><p>One of the characters that has sparked a lot of curiosity among the fans is Tom Fuller, the husband of Cynthia Fuller, who is Georgia’s political rival and later friend. Tom is seen in a comatose state throughout the second season of the show, and many viewers are wondering what happened to him and why Georgia decided to kill him in the end.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tom’s illness and coma</strong></h2><p>Tom Fuller (played by Vincent Legault) suffered from a serious illness (which is not explicitly revealed on the show), and doctors reveal that recovery is not in the cards. According to Netflix Life, Tom is in a locked-in state, which means that he is aware of his surroundings but unable to move or communicate. He is hooked up to monitors and feeding tubes in his living room, where Cynthia takes care of him with the help of a nurse.</p><p>Cynthia struggles to cope with her husband’s condition, as she feels guilty for not being able to help him or make him happy. She also has to deal with her son Zach, who is angry and resentful towards his father for leaving them in this situation. Cynthia tries to find some distraction in her political campaign against Paul Randolph, Georgia’s fiancé and the mayor of Wellsbury, but she also faces criticism and harassment from the public for her personal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Georgia’s mercy killing</strong></h2><p>In the penultimate episode of season 2, Georgia visits Cynthia at her home after Cynthia helps her get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Gil. The two women have a heart-to-heart conversation in the kitchen, where Cynthia opens up about her feelings for Tom and how hard it is to watch him suffer. She also reveals that she had an affair with Joe, Georgia’s ex-boyfriend and the owner of Blue Farm Cafe, but she broke it off because she realized that Joe was still in love with Georgia.</p><p>After their talk, Georgia walks into Tom’s room and smothers him with a pillow until he dies. It is unclear why Georgia decided to commit such a horrible deed, but one could guess that it was her way of expressing her gratitude to Cynthia for helping her out with Gil. It could also be that Georgia felt sorry for Cynthia and wanted to end her pain by freeing her from Tom’s burden. However, she could have expressed her thankfulness or sympathy in another way other than murder.</p><p>Georgia’s act of killing Tom was witnessed by her son Austin, who was hiding in a cabinet in the room. Austin was traumatized by what he saw, and he ran away from home with Ginny at the end of the season finale. This leaves Georgia in a precarious situation, as she now has to deal with the consequences of her actions and the possibility of losing her children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What will happen next?</strong></h2><p>The fate of Tom Fuller and his family will likely have a major impact on the plot of Ginny and Georgia season 3, if the show gets renewed by Netflix. Fans are eager to know how Cynthia will react when she finds out that her husband is dead and that Georgia was responsible for it. Will she be grateful or furious? Will she expose Georgia’s secret or keep it to herself? How will this affect her relationship with Paul and Joe?</p><p>Moreover, fans are also curious about how Georgia will handle the aftermath of her murder. Will she be able to cover up her tracks or will she be caught by the police or by Gabriel Cordova, the private investigator who has been following her? How will she explain Tom’s death to Cynthia and Zach? How will she deal with Austin’s trauma and Ginny’s rebellion? Will she be able to keep her family together or will she lose everything?</p><p>These are some of the questions that fans hope to get answered in the next season of Ginny and Georgia. The show has not been officially renewed yet, but given its popularity and cliffhanger ending, there is a high chance that it will return for more episodes. Until then, fans can rewatch the first two seasons on Netflix and enjoy the drama, humor, and mystery that Ginny and Georgia has to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfrLWiwIyiqmavoqS7qHnWoquhZaSkum61zWaeoqaernqiusNmnp6nopy2onnToZxmrKKWtKqvjK2prqyYYq%2BmtMinm2abqaPBqbXArGShraOXrq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dd-why-gary-gygaxs-wife-was-convinced-he-was-having-an-affair.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Gary Gygax's Wife Was Convinced He Was Having An Affair</a>
