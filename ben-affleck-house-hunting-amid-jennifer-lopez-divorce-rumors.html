The news comes just days after Lopez was spotted in Los Angeles <a href=#>looking for a home of her own</a>. It's not unusual for celebrities of their level to own multiple homes, but the timing is suspicious, as the <a href=#>couple is alleged to be heading for divorce</a>.</p><h2 id=is-ben-affleck-on-the-market-for-a-new-home>Is Ben Affleck On The Market For A New Home?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At present, there appears to be very little information about Ben Affleck's house hunting, aside from the report that he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looking for a home</a>. Earlier this week, his wife (or soon-to-be ex-wife, if the rumors are to be believed) Jennifer Lopez, was seen looking at a home in Beverly Hills with her producing partner, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas. According to InTouch Weekly, it was not immediately clear why she was checking out the home.</p><p>However, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck and Lopez no longer lived together</a>. ​​"The writing is on the wall – it's over," an insider told the publication. "They're headed for a divorce – and for once, [Ben's] not to blame!" They continued, "He's focusing on his work and his kids now. Ben already moved out, and they'll likely have to sell the dream house they spent two years searching for. They'll never stop loving each other, but she can't control him, and he can't change her. There's no way it could have lasted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>InTouch Weekly also shared insight into the couple's relationship and how they had been spending time apart. "Ben and J. Lo are normally together 24/7, but lately, they've been spending time apart," the insider said. "Jen's need to make their relationship so public and perfect often leaves Ben feeling overwhelmed and henpecked. He just needs to be by himself sometimes, out of her shadow."</p><h2 id=what-are-the-clues-that-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-are-having-marriage-troubles>What Are The Clues That Ben Affleck And Jennifer Lopez Are Having Marriage Troubles?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>There are many reports about Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's relationship and how they have been having problems</strong>. The actress recently got fan's attention when <a href=#>she liked an Instagram post about relationships</a>. "You cannot build a healthy relationship with someone who ... Lacks integrity and emotional safety", the post reads. "Doesn't respect your time, doesn't think it's important to call/text back in a respectable time frame," "Lacks effective communication skills = silent treatment, withdraws, refuses to communicate unless it's on their terms," and "Doesn't know who they are or what they want."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8-03-33-am.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez Disses Ben Affleck As She Admits To Refusing His Help Preparing For Movie Roles">Jennifer Lopez Disses Ben Affleck As She Admits To Refusing His Help Preparing For Movie Roles</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Lopez did little to quell the reports of marital problems when she admited she refuses to work with husband Ben Affleck.</p><p>Could this be a clue to her impending divorce? That remains unclear, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people have noticed that Lopez liked the post</a>, and the comments on it reflect this. "Not @jlo liking this," one Instagram user wrote. Others have theories as to why this is, and it doesn't include Affleck. "​​I believe she liked the post based on her self-made movie, which is the same message she is trying to convey. It’s not about Ben."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some have even offered advice to Lopez in what they feel is a challenging time. "@jlo, Please slow down and remember what you wanted out of your marriage to Ben," a comment reads. "You were so happy. How many home or things or projects can you have? Without your partner what does it mean? I'm hoping with all my heart you guys will work it all out.
