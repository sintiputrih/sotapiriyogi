That night, he forced oral sex and intercourse with her: “I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen.

He dropped the towel, took the folder, and eventually asked her to give him a massage.

But when she arrived, he was naked in the bathtub, and he suggested she would be more comfortable if she were naked, too. He told her that if she didn’t show her breasts in private, she wouldn’t be able to do it in the film, as her character may have a topless scene.

I assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common.When I arrived ,reception told me to go to his room . He opened the door in his bathrobe . I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older ,unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him .After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left ,uneasy but unscathed.A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting .I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not .I had what I thought were boundaries - I said no to him professionally many times over the years-some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a cunt and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people oh "Kate lives to say no to me ." It speaks to the status quo in this business that I was aware that standing up for myself and saying no to things,while it did allow me to feel uncompromised in myself,undoubtedly harmed my career and was never something I felt supported by anyone other than my family.I would like to applaud the women who have come forward , and to pledge that we can from this create a new paradigm where producers,managers,executives and assistants and everyone who has in the past shrugged and said " well, that's just Harvey /Mr X/insert name here " will realize that we in numbers can affect real change.For every moment like this there have been thousands where a vulnerable person has confided outrageous unprofessional behavior and found they have no recourse, due to an atmosphere of fear that it seems almost everyone has been living in .I had a male friend who, based on my experience,warned a young actress who said she was going to dinner with Harvey to be careful. He received a phone call the next day saying he would never work in another Miramax film ;the girl was already sleeping with Harvey and had told him that my friend had warned her off.Let's stop allowing our young women to be sexual cannon fodder,and let's remember that Harvey is an emblem of a system that is sick,and that we have work to do.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Kate Beckinsale</a> (@katebeckinsale) on Oct 12, 2017 at 6:02am PDT</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtjk000e3d5xlpl0w061@published data-word-count=6><strong>Actress Rosanna Arquette – Early ’90s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtjl000f3d5xjl2nivs2@published data-word-count=87>Actress Rosanna Arquette&nbsp;<a href=#>told&nbsp;</a>The New Yorker&nbsp;that in the early ’90s, she met Weinstein at his hotel room — and he opened the door wearing a white bathrobe and asking her for a neck massage.

Weinstein offered to drop Sciorra off after a dinner event, and she didn’t think anything of it.

I&nbsp;fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door? Who opens the door at that time of night? I was definitely embarrassed by it. I felt disgusting.

One night he showed up and pounded on her door: “For nights after, I couldn’t sleep. I piled furniture in front of the door, like in the movies,” she said. In 1997, while promoting the same movie at Cannes, Weinstein booked the hotel room next to hers. Early one morning, he knocked on her door. “There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she recalled to The New Yorker. “And it was horrific, because I’d been there before.” She dialed hotel staff, and Weinstein retreated once they arrived.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtjo000i3d5xtd0alprw@published data-word-count=8><strong>Fashion designer and actress Tara Subkoff – 1990s</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtjo000j3d5x2wdygyxm@published data-word-count=192>Actress and fashion designer Tara Subkoff, who co-founded the label Imitation of Christ, told&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety</a>&nbsp;that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her in the 1990s the night she was offered a role in one of his films.

The following day, my agent said he wanted to see me for a general meeting. The location was set for his hotel room. I wasn’t comfortable with going to his room & said so. The following day, we sat down with an assistant in the hotel restaurant. He bullshit me for 5 minutes re: movies he could put me in, then asked the assistant to excuse us. As she walked away, he said, "I know you were feeling what I was feeling when we met the other night” and then regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc. IF I would be his girlfriend. Or, “We could just keep this professional.” All I knew was not to offend this very powerful man and to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional. He said “Fine. I trust you won't tell anyone about this.” I said “Of course not. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me,” - the only way I could think to shut it down gracefully and excuse myself. I immediately told my agent what happened. We marveled at his audacity, reinforced my instinct not to offend him & laughed at how glad I was to get out of there. Neither of us were that surprised as this wasn’t far off from the day-to-day bullshit of being an actress. I'm sorry for obliging his orders to be complicit in protecting his behavior, which he obviously knew was wrong or he wouldn’t have asked me not to tell anyone in the first place. For making him feel ok about the gross things he was saying and that I felt my only route was to say I was flattered. For not insisting that my reps never allow anyone to take a meeting in a hotel room (with him or anyone else), because I honestly don’t know what might have happened if I’d just showed up as originally scheduled. I am appalled for all the women being told these occurrences are in any way their fault. No more Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood does not solve the problem but maybe the more voices sharing their stories and adding support to the countless women and men who have suffered through abuse of power, the less it will be tolerated.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Minka Kelly</a> (@minkakelly) on Oct 13, 2017 at 8:03am PDT</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtlg002k3d5x05s24fid@published data-word-count=5><strong>Actress Angie Everhart – Unknown</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ugjtlg002l3d5xjimhki9d@published data-word-count=139>Actress Angie Everhart told a KLOS morning radio show, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, that Weinstein masturbated in front of her while they were staying on the same boat during the Venice Film Festival.
