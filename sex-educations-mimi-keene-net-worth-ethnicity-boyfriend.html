In fact, almost everything about the Sex Education star is a bit of a mystery. For an up-and-coming star who could have a massive social media following due to the success of her character Ruby Matthews on the hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> show, Mimi keeps things pretty close to the chest. All of this makes Sex Education fans all the more curious about who this talented and ridiculously beautiful star actually is and where her net worth ranks among <a href=#>the wealthiest Sex Education cast members</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a lot of conflicting reports about Mimi Keene's net worth as well as what her ethnicity is or if she's secretly dating her on-screen boyfriend, Asa Butterfield. Here are all the conflicting reports and the nuggets of truth found within each of them.</p><h2 id=mimi-keenes-39-net-worth-may-be-more-impressive-than-we-think>Mimi Keenes' Net Worth May Be More Impressive Than We Think</h2><p>The Hertfordshire, England-born actor is said to be worth a whopping $2 million or even $2.5 million, according to various publications like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idol Net Worth</a>. However, other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publications like Taddlr</a> claim that Mimi is worth a much more modest $600,000 US. Had Mimi Keene only been know for<a href=#> her somewhat controversial role as Otis's new girlfriend</a> on Sex Education, the latter would probably be more accurate. After all, Mimi is part of an ensemble cast on a Netflix show which isn't exactly known for having massive budgets... at least until the series becomes uber-successful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Is Divided Over Whether This 'Sex Education' Character Is A Villain</a></span></p><p>Despite premiering in 2019, Sex Education really only became popular throughout the global pandemic while people were stuck at home and trying to find the next great Netflix series to binge. Therefore, Mimi's salary on Sex Education isn't likely to be a big earner. At least, not yet. However, another show in her filmography may have helped her earn a net worth closer to NewsUnzip's claim of $2.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Mimi was part of another ensemble cast of EastEnders, the BBC soap opera employed her for a whopping 122 episodes. Of course, soap opera money isn't exactly primetime or streamer money, but 122 episodes is A LOT of episodes. Especially given the fact that they were shot between 2013 and 2015. Given the success of the long-running soap opera, as well as the number of episodes Mimi's Cindy Williams was a part of, it definitely makes sense that her net worth is as high as $2 million or $2.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Sex Education’ Star, Connor Swindells Worth?</a></span></p><p>While EastEnders and Sex Education may be the two roles that Mimi is best known for, the 23-year-old star has been acting since 2010. Prior to EastEnders, Mimi was working in theater and snagged guest spots on a few TV shows, but after the soap, she started getting cast in more high-profile projects. This includes the movie Close with Noomi Repace and as a younger version of J.R.R. Tolkien's wife in the 2019 film Tolkien.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-mystery-of-mimi-39-s-ethnicity-and-personal-life>The Mystery Of Mimi's Ethnicity And Personal Life</h2><p>Given Mimi's very unique look, fans have naturally wondered about her background and heritage. Fans have guessed that she's got Italian heritage as well as Middle Eastern. The truth is, we know every little about it. Her mother, Alexis Keene, is Caucasian from England while her father, Hassan Saeed appears to be from South Asia or the Middle East, according to The Focus News. However, given Mimi's level of secrecy regarding her family, we still don't know precisely what her ethnicity is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other mystery is whether or not she's actually dating Asa Butterfield, her on-screen love interest. While some fans are convinced there's something going on between them, there's absolutely no evidence to suggest that they are together. Additionally, Mimi has been smart about keeping her love life absolutely private. In fact, she seems to be extremely good about keeping most of her personal life a secret... At least, for now. As Ruby becomes a bigger star, we're sure this will be more challenging to do.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Sex Education' Fans Look Back On The Importance Of That Bus Scene</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though neither Mimi nor Asa have confirmed that there's actually going on between them, fans are still shipping them. And this is surprising, at least to Mimi, who doesn't think everyone will even be on board with their characters getting together. In an interview with Country & Town House, she had this to say, "It’s definitely unexpected, and it’s probably a split audience. There are a lot of people that are die-hard Otis and Maeve, and I can see why. I think Ruby and Otis are a really funny combination. They’re two very different characters, and they bounce off each other nicely. I’ve seen some support online for Ruby and Otis together."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Ncuti Gatwa Talks About The Importance Of Playing A Black Queer Teen On 'Sex Education'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnrBdmrG2r8CtoKimo2K6qrnIZqKenZ6aeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqmwMenoJyhpK56o7vYn6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-jason-kelce-heartbreaking-family-story-romance-taylor-swift-brother.html>&#171;&nbsp;Travis Kelce's heartbreaking family history revealed amid Taylor Swift romance</a>
