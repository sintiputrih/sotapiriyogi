She later made an apology video where she claimed to be half-Filipino, but netizens were not convinced and demanded her arrest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Car Accident Video</strong></h3><p>On May 18, 2023, a TikTok user named @sam.anthabong shared a video of an altercation that occurred due to a car accident involving Ashley Barkis and an Asian driver and his family. The video showed Ashley Barkis aggressively approaching the other car and hurling racist questions at them, such as asking for their driving license and if they were even legal to be in the USA. She also physically assaulted the driver by kicking him into the approaching traffic, which could have resulted in his death. According to the text overlay in the video, the Asian driver had allegedly hit Ashley Barkis’s car, but she was clearly overreacting and being abusive.</p><p>The video went viral on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, where many people identified Ashley Barkis as the woman in the video. They also found out that she worked as a sales manager at a gym called 24 Hour Fitness, and tagged the company to take action against her. Some people also claimed that Ashley Barkis was later arrested, but there was no official confirmation of this.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Apology Video</strong></h3><p>After receiving a lot of backlash and criticism for her racist and violent behavior, Ashley Barkis made an apology video where she tried to explain her side of the story. She said that she wanted to apologize to the Asian family for any pain or grief that she might have caused them, and that she did not condone any form of violence or racism against anyone. She also said that the video did not show the entire story and that there were certain things that were taken out of context. She claimed that she only wanted to take proper pictures of the other driver’s driving license, but it was difficult to do so because he was not properly holding it out.</p><p>However, the most controversial part of her apology video was when she said that she wanted to apologize to the Asian community, as she was half-Filipino. She said that her mother was from the Philippines and that she grew up with Filipino culture and values. She said that she loved her Filipino heritage and that she was not racist towards Asians.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Netizens’ Reaction</strong></h3><p>Ashley Barkis’s apology video did not go down well with netizens, who were outraged by her claim of being half-Filipino. They said that being half-Filipino did not excuse her racism and violence, and that she was using it as a way to avoid accountability. They also questioned her authenticity and credibility, as they pointed out that she had never mentioned or shown any signs of being half-Filipino before. They said that she was lying about her ethnicity to gain sympathy and escape punishment.</p><p>Many netizens also expressed their support and solidarity with the Asian family who were victimized by Ashley Barkis. They said that they hoped that they were safe and well, and that they deserved justice and compensation for what they had gone through. They also condemned Ashley Barkis for her actions and said that she should be arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault, battery, hate crime, and other offenses.</p><p>Ashley Barkis is a social media influencer and content creator who became infamous for her racist and violent behavior towards an Asian family in a car accident.
