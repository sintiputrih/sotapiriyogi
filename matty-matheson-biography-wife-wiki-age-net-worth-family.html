Canada<span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span><span>His career began when he was employed as a regular employee at Le Sélect Bistro.&nbsp;</span><span>He was also at another restaurant called La Pallette where he worked for a couple of years from 2006 to 2008.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Young Matty became a restaurant owner at the age of 21. Parts and Labour, as his restaurant is called, is one of the most popular restaurants in all of Canada.&nbsp;</span><span>Matty has gained popularity on Instagram, where he posts wild food-related antics.&nbsp;</span><span>Away from the kitchen, he’s one of the greatest tattoo lovers of all time.&nbsp;</span><span>Most of his skin is covered with images such as his angel tattoo, which was featured by vice.com on February 2, 2017.&nbsp;</span><span>The celebrity chef and TV host revealed in an interview with Jessica Swaffer (tattoo artist) that he received his first inscription at the age of 17.</span></span></p><h2><strong>Matty Matheson’s Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p><span><span>Matthew James Matheson was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on February 7, 1986. The popular Canadian chef is the son of Stephen Matheson, who works as an engineer, and Joan Matheson, who makes a living as a waitress.&nbsp;</span><span>He grew up with a couple of brothers namely Adam Matheson and Stephen Matheson along with a single sister known as Sarah Matheson.</span></span></p><p><span><span>After completing his chef training and culinary management course at Humber College, he was employed at a French restaurant called Le Sélect Bistro.&nbsp;</span><span>After a while he moved to La Palette restaurant which helped him gain a wealth of experience in French education as well as in the culinary arts.&nbsp;</span><span>After honing his skills through a partnership with Oddfellows in 2010, Matty Matheson co-founded monthly themed dinners with Toronto’s successful group of chefs at multiple Toronto venues, unique locations and restaurants.&nbsp;</span><span>Keep it Canada is the name of his web series which has garnered tremendous popularity on social media platforms.&nbsp;</span><span>The Toronto native is also a part owner of&nbsp;</span></span>Ossington Bridal Shop LoversLand<span>founded by his wife.</span></p><h2><strong>Wife and family of Matty Matheson</strong></h2><p><span><span>According to The Vine, Matty Matheson and his wife Trish Spencer were a longtime friend whose relationship began in high school, but the TV host stayed silent on the statement.&nbsp;</span><span>However, the duo’s wedding vows were exchanged in August 2014 in Port Dover Beach, Ontario, Canada.&nbsp;</span><span>Their wedding, which came after several years of romantic involvement, was strong for almost five years and is still counting.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Trish rose to prominence as the founder and co-owner of Loversland, having launched a booming career as a fashion and lifestyle specialist.&nbsp;</span><span>Even before the beginning of their life in marriage, the couple was blessed with their first child – a little boy named Macarthur, whose date of birth is not known to the public.&nbsp;</span><span>This could be because his birth occurred before their marriage.&nbsp;</span><span>For his part, the celebrity chef seems completely smitten with his son as he keeps sharing his photos on Instagram.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Four years after their marriage, on October 31, 2018, Matty Matheson and his wife welcomed their second bundle of joy — a daughter named Rizzo Louise Matheson.&nbsp;</span><span>The proud dad wasted no time in sharing the amazing news with the photo of his second child on Instagram.&nbsp;</span><span>The duo seems to be the ideal couple, who have a lot of support and understanding for each other and live a happy married life, which may be the reason why the paparazzi never caught the attention of marital disputes or conflicts.</span></span></p><h2><strong>Wealth (income and earnings)</strong></h2><p><span><span>On an annual basis, Matty Matheson’s earnings on both his television shows and restaurant business have ranged from $157,000 to $339,000.&nbsp;</span><span>However, this can be exceeded depending on the prevailing factors.&nbsp;</span><span>The Canadian chef not only makes money from the business and his TV shows, but has also worked with several hotels in the hospitality industry.&nbsp;</span><span>His 2018 net worth figure was $2 million and it’s only logical to expect the 2019 rating to bring some good news as the celebrity chef remains very active in both his restaurant business and on TV shows.</span></span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-aa8bec168f9a2268afb2addc- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.
